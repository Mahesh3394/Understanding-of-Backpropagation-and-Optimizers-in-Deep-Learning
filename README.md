# Understanding-of-Backpropagation-and-Optimizers-in-Deep-Learning

## Backpropagation :

Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training deep neural networks. It is a method for computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the neural network. The gradients are then used to update the weights and biases in the opposite direction of the gradient, with the aim of minimizing the loss function and improving the performance of the network.

The backpropagation algorithm works by propagating the error in the output of the network back through the layers to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases in each layer. The computation is done in two phases: forward pass and backward pass.

In the forward pass, the input data is passed through the network, and the output of each layer is computed using the weights and biases of that layer. The output of the last layer is compared to the true label of the input, and the difference between the predicted output and the true label is the loss.

In the backward pass, the error is propagated back through the layers using the chain rule of calculus to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of each layer. The gradients are then used to update the weights and biases in the opposite direction of the gradient, using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent.

Backpropagation is a powerful algorithm that has enabled the training of deep neural networks with multiple layers, which has led to significant advances in many areas of machine learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, backpropagation can suffer from issues such as vanishing gradients and overfitting, which have led to the development of more advanced optimization algorithms and regularization techniques.

## Optimizers:

Optimizers are algorithms used in deep learning to update the parameters of a neural network during training. The goal of an optimizer is to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights and biases of the network.

There are several types of optimizers used in deep learning, including:

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):
SGD is a basic optimization algorithm that updates the weights and biases of the network in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. The learning rate determines the step size of the updates and is often adjusted during training to improve performance.

- Adagrad:
Adagrad is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each weight and bias in the network based on the historical gradient information. This allows the learning rate to be decreased for frequently occurring features and increased for infrequent features, which can improve performance.

- Adam:
Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of both SGD and Adagrad. It computes adaptive learning rates for each weight and bias in the network based on both the first and second moments of the gradients. This allows it to handle sparse gradients and noisy data, and often results in faster convergence and better performance.

- RMSProp:
RMSProp is another adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that maintains a moving average of the squared gradients and adjusts the learning rate based on this average. It can be effective in dealing with the vanishing gradient problem and improving the convergence rate of the network.

- Adadelta:
Adadelta is an extension of Adagrad that addresses its tendency to decrease the learning rate too aggressively over time. It uses a moving window of gradients to compute the adaptive learning rate, which allows it to adapt more quickly to changes in the gradient.

The choice of optimizer depends on factors such as the size of the network, the nature of the data, and the complexity of the problem being solved. SGD is a basic optimizer that is often used as a starting point, while the other optimizers are more advanced and can improve performance in specific scenarios.
